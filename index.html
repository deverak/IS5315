      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open-source project that allows developers and system administrators to quickly access and deploy new versions of web applications under different development environments, virtually anywhere. For example, with Docker, an individual would be able to build an application on a Windows laptop inside a Docker container and then take an image of that container and deploy it to a Linux production environment. This reduces the dependency for the main system, meaning that a person would not have to consider whether or not they will be installed as the same environment the application was built on.</p>
      <p>Docker is a computer program that performs "containerization." A container does not virtualize the hardware but instead packages up the code and its dependencies to ensure some consistency, efficiency, and reliability in varying environments. </p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Originally Nginx was designed as a web server to optimize performance and stability. Now, Nginx is an open-source web server and a multifunctional tool that can be deployed as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer. Nginx is able to better manage incoming traffic and distribute connections to slower upstream servers because of its ability to manage a high volume of connections.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A Virtual Machine or "image" simulates a computer system by virtualizing computer hardware in a secure manner. This means that changes made in the virtual machine will have no lasting effects on the physical hardware that it's running on. Virtual machines provide the same functionality of a physical computer and gives the end user the same experience as a host operating system itself. This is an optimal environment for testing other software in other environment such as during beta releases and running applications on operating systems that differ from the intended operating system.</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - DigitalOcean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing service that provides an Infrastructure as a Service. This means that DigitalOcean simplifies managing infrastructure for developers and teams while offering the option to deploy multiple virtual machines or "Droplets." DigitalOcean is a reliable platform that allows developers to scale, rebuild, and redirect network traffic between droplets. </p>
